Hi,
   
I sent in an application on June 16 for the advertised role of Software Engineer.  I wanted to ask if you have had time to review my resume and qualifications, as well as inquire into the status of the hiring process.  

My combination of experience, skill, and genuine enthusiasm for the position make me a strong candidate. As a mathematician, I carry a robust understanding of algorithm design and quantitative analysis that uniquely positions me to thrive in the constantly evolving role of Software Engineer.  

Drawn to Freshfresh Alberta Co. Ltd because of your commitment to sustainability, I wanted to re-express my interest in joining your team.  I appreciate any information you are able to provide, and cordially state my availability for an interview.  

I have re-attached my resume for your convenience.

Looking forward to hearing from you!  

Best,
