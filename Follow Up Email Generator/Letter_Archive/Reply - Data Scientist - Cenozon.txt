Hi,
   
I sent in an application on June 21 for the advertised role of Data Scientist .  I wanted to ask if you have you had time to review my resume and qualifications, as well as inquire into the status of the hiring process.  

My combination of experience, skill, and genuine enthusiasm for the position make me a strong candidate. As a mathematician, I carry a highly developed understanding of data structures and analytical algorithms that uniquely positions me to contribute effective insights in the role of Data Scientist.  

Drawn to Cenozon because of your commitment to technologically-driven innovation, I wanted to re-express my interest in joining your team.   I appreciate any information you are able to provide, and cordially state my availability for an interview.  

I have re-attached my resume for your convenience.

Looking forward to hearing from you!  

Best,    


Jacob Mattie
