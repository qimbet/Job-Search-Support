Hi,
   
I sent in an application on June 21 for the advertised role of Software Developer. I wanted to ask if you have had time to review my resume and qualifications, as well as inquire into the status of the hiring process.  

My combination of experience, skill, and genuine enthusiasm for the position make me a strong candidate. As a mathematician, I carry a highly developed understanding of data structures and analytical algorithms that uniquely positions me to thrive in SGA's growth in the AI sector.  

Drawn to SGA AI because of your leading role in the rapidly growing AI sector, I wanted to re-express my interest in joining your team.  I appreciate any information you are able to provide, and cordially state my availability for an interview.  

I have re-attached my resume for your convenience.

Looking forward to hearing from you!  

Best,    


Jacob Mattie
