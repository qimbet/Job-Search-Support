Hi,
   
I sent in an application on June 14 for the advertised role of Backend Engineer.  I wanted to ask if you have had time to review my resume and qualifications, as well as inquire into the status of the hiring process.  

My combination of experience, skill, and genuine enthusiasm for the position make me a strong candidate. As a mathematician, I carry an aptitude in unifying a broad array of technical concepts that uniquely positions me to thrive in the role of.  

Drawn to Midas Labs because of your drive to stay on the cutting edge of technology, I wanted to re-express my interest in joining your team.  I appreciate any information you are able to provide, and cordially state my availability for an interview.  

I have re-attached my resume for your convenience.

Looking forward to hearing from you!  

Best,
