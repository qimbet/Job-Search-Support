Hi,
   
I sent in an application on June 21 for the advertised role of Software Developer. I wanted to ask if you have had time to review my resume and qualifications, as well as inquire into the status of the hiring process.  

My combination of experience, skill, and genuine enthusiasm for the position make me a strong candidate. As a mathematician, I carry an aptitude in unifying a broad array of technical concepts that uniquely positions me to thrive in the constantly evolving role of Software Developer.  

Drawn to Rise Education Ltd. because of your commitment to technologically-driven innovation, I wanted to re-express my interest in joining your team. I appreciate any information you are able to provide, and cordially state my availability for an interview.  

I have re-attached my resume for your convenience.

Looking forward to hearing from you!  

Best,    


Jacob Mattie
