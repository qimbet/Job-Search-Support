Hi John Doe,
   
I sent in an application on September 30 for the advertised role of Data Scientist. I wanted to ask if you have had time to review my resume and qualifications, as well as inquire into the status of the hiring process.  

My combination of experience, skill, and genuine enthusiasm for the position make me a strong candidate. As a mathematician, I carry mathematics that uniquely positions me to lift heavy things.  

Drawn to FakeCo.org because of your cool logo, I wanted to re-express my interest in joining your team. I appreciate any information you are able to provide regarding my application, and cordially state my availability for an interview.  

I have re-attached my resume for your convenience.

Looking forward to hearing from you! 

Jacob Mattie
